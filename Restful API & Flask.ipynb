What is a RESTful API?\n","- A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. It is stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it.\n","2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n","- API specification is a detailed document that defines how an API should behave. It describes the available endpoints, request methods, input parameters, response formats, authentication methods, and error codes. It serves as a guideline for developers to understand how to interact with the API correctly.\n","3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n","- Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It is popular for building APIs because it is easy to use, requires minimal setup, supports extensions, and allows developers to quickly create RESTful endpoints with clear and simple code.\n","4. What is routing in Flask?\n","- Routing in Flask is the process of defining URL patterns that are connected to specific functions in the application. When a user accesses a URL, Flask matches it to a defined route and calls the associated function to generate a response.\n","5. How do you create a simple Flask application.\n","- A simple Flask application is created by importing the Flask module, creating an instance of the Flask class, and defining routes using the `@app.route()` decorator. Each route is linked to a function that returns a response. Finally, the application is run using the `app.run()` method. This sets up a basic web server that can handle HTTP requests.\n","6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n","- The HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:\n","\n","* **GET** - Retrieves data from the server.\n","* **POST** - Sends new data to the server.\n","* **PUT** - Updates existing data on the server.\n","* **DELETE** - Removes data from the server.\n","* **PATCH** - Partially updates existing data on the server.\n","7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n","- The `@app.route()` decorator in Flask is used to define the URL route for a specific function. It tells Flask which URL should trigger the execution of that function, allowing the application to respond to specific web requests.\n","8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n","- The GET method is used to request data from the server without making any changes, and the data is sent in the URL.\n","The POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update resources, and the data is sent in the body of the request.\n","9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n","- Errors in Flask APIs are handled using error handlers. Flask provides a way to define custom responses for specific error codes using the `@app.errorhandler()` decorator. This allows the API to return meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes when something goes wrong, such as 404 for \"Not Found\" or 500 for \"Internal Server Error\".\n","10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n","- Flask can be connected to a SQL database using libraries like SQLAlchemy or Flask-SQLAlchemy. These libraries allow you to define database models, establish a connection to the database, and perform operations like insert, update, delete, and query. You configure the database URI in the Flask app and initialize the database connection through the library.\n","11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n","- Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension of Flask that integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask applications. It simplifies database operations by allowing developers to define models as Python classes and interact with the database using object-oriented methods. It manages connections, queries, and schema definitions more easily within a Flask app.\n","12.  What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n","- Flask blueprints are a way to organize a Flask application into smaller, modular components. They allow you to group related routes, templates, and static files together. Blueprints are useful for creating large applications by keeping the codebase clean, maintainable, and easier to manage by separating functionality into different modules.\n","13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n","- Flask's request object is used to access data sent by the client in an HTTP request. It allows you to retrieve form data, query parameters, JSON data, headers, and more. This object helps the server understand and process the client's input.\n","14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n","- To create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask, you define a route using the `@app.route()` decorator and specify the HTTP method (like GET or POST). Inside the associated function, you write the logic to handle the request and return a response, usually in JSON format. This allows the endpoint to interact with clients following REST principles.\n","15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n","- The purpose of Flask's `jsonify()` function is to convert Python data structures like dictionaries or lists into a JSON response. It also sets the correct MIME type (`application/json`) for the response, making it suitable for RESTful APIs.\n","16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n","- Flask’s `url_for()` function is used to build a URL for a specific function defined in the application. Instead of hardcoding URLs, it generates them dynamically based on the function name, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n","17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n","- Flask handles static files by placing them in a folder named `static` within the project directory. These files can be accessed in templates using the `url_for('static', filename='path/to/file')` function. Flask automatically serves files from this folder when requested.\n","18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n","- An API specification is a detailed description of how an API should work, including its endpoints, methods, input parameters, responses, and error codes. It helps in building a Flask API by serving as a blueprint for developers, ensuring consistency, clarity, and proper communication between different parts of the system or with third-party users.\n","19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n","- HTTP status codes are standard response codes returned by the server to indicate the result of a client's request. They help the client understand whether the request was successful, resulted in an error, or requires further action. In a Flask API, using proper status codes improves communication, error handling, and the overall reliability of the API.\n","20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n","- POST requests in Flask are handled by defining a route with the `methods=['POST']` argument in the `@app.route()` decorator. Inside the function, you can access the submitted data using the `request` object, such as `request.form` for form data or `request.json` for JSON data. The server then processes the data and returns an appropriate response.\n","21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n","- To secure a Flask API, you can use the following methods:\n","\n","* **Authentication** - Implement token-based authentication like JWT or API keys.\n","* **Authorization** - Restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.\n","* **Input validation** - Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.\n","* **HTTPS** - Use HTTPS to encrypt data during transmission.\n","* **Rate limiting** - Limit the number of requests to prevent abuse.\n","* **Error handling** - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.\n","* **CORS policy** - Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to control who can access the API.\n","22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n","- The Flask-RESTful extension simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs with Flask. It provides tools and classes to define resources, handle different HTTP methods easily, and organize code in a cleaner and more structured way. It also supports features like input parsing, request validation, and standardized error handling, making API development faster and more efficient.\n","23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n","- Flask’s session object is used to store data specific to a user across multiple requests. It allows the server to remember information like login status or user preferences. The data is stored on the client side in a secure cookie and can be accessed and modified using the `session` object in Flask.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"inPvmdU5P2rr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"mb266JLZqdqA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
